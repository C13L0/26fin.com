<h3>Family Focused Activities and Organizations</h3>
<p>Family-centered and children-centered organizations play an important role in communities as a hub of health and well-being</p>
<p>Organizations that put emphasis on family wellness and healthy activities are taking center stage as the focus on health becomes a community-wide issue. These organizations offer an affordable, safe and fun atmosphere for all ages, usually charging a monthly membership fee, often waived for low-income families.</p>
<p>TwoSix Financial understands the unique needs of these types of organizations and offers the best solutions to meet their unique enrollment requirements. </p>

<h6>Enrollment and Membership Fees</h6>
<p>Membership often drives the success of these family focused organizations, and enabling members to easily pay their membership fees ensures faster collections and better accounting. By accepting membership fees online or in the facility, you allow your members to easily keep up to date on their membership at their convenience. </p>

<h6>Smooth Registrations</h6>
<p>When you accept registration payments online, you not only provide a convenience for those registering, but your team/organization has an accurate report of confirmed registrations and have the information you need to plan accordingly. </p>

<h6>Equipment/Uniform Orders</h6>
<p>Many team sports require teammates to purchase their own equipment and uniforms. Often has been the case where the sports director or coach is expected to organize the order,collect the money, write a check to cover the cost of it all - and cross his or her fingers it all works out.  </p>

<p>By allowing these orders to be placed online, you mitigate the headache of asking a coach or sports director to manage the process by streamlining orders, payment, and verification. </p>
