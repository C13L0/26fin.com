<h3>Parent Teacher Organization / Parent Teacher Association</h3>

<h5>Increase your group's income and ability to grant money to you school with increase revenue collection</h5>
<p>Parent-run, school-based organizations have the ability to raise a generous amount of funds from donations, fundraisers and programs - and by using TwoSix Financial's solutions, that revenue can be realized, collected and tracked with ease.</p>

<h5><a href="products-and-services/debit-credit-card.html">Credit and Debit Card Acceptance</a></h5>
<p>Accept credit and debit cards for spirit wear, book fairs, school supply purchases, and other fundraising programs</p>

<h5><a href="products-and-services/check-acceptance.html">Check Acceptance</a></h5>
<p>Parents are still asked to pay for several items throughout the school year and most tend to send a check in with their child rather than cash or a credit card number. TwoSix Financial can accept and validate these checks immediately and your organization can realize this revenue faster. </p>

<h5><a href="products-and-services/gift-and-loyalty-cards.html">Loyalty / Gift Cards</a></h5>
<p>Customize a gift card for spirit wear or other school related merchandise and use as an incentive for students and parents alike.  This keeps your money within your  organization and offers a unique branding option.</p>
