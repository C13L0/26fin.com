<h3>Private Instruction</h3>

<h6>With automatic payments, private instructors can realize higher monthly revenues while offering a convenience to students</h6>
<p>Most private instructors are small businesses, owned and operated by professionals whose first passion is the highest possible standards for their craft and their students. TwoSix Financial eases the accounting burden from these teachers by easing the stress of payment collections.</p>

<p>Instructors have the options to collect payment through <a href="products-and-services/debit-credit-card.html">credit or debit cards </a> in person, at their facility, or online in one-off or recurring payments. In addition, all <a href="products-and-services/check-acceptance.html"> checks </a> are immediately validated for acceptance, eliminating the need to run to the bank during inconvenient bank hours. </p>
<p><a href="produts-and-services/gift-and-loyalyt-cards.html"> Gift and Loyalty cards </a> are another great way of extending your brand, offering incentives to current or potential students to maintain enrollment all while keeping your marketing dollars working for you. </p>
