<h3>Daycare and Playcare</h3>

<h6>By setting up automatic payments, childcare providers can realize higher monthly revenues while offering a convenience to parents</h6></p>

<p>Most daycare operations are small businesses, owned and operated by professionals whose first passion is the highest possible standards for the children in their charge. TwoSix Financial wants to ease the accounting burden from these caregivers by easing the stress of payment collections.</p>

<p>Operators have the ability to accept credit and debit cards in person, at their facility, or online in one-off or recurring payments. In addition, all checks can be immediately validated for acceptance, eliminating the need to run to the bank during inconvenient bank hours</p>
<!--<p>Additionally, with Debit Card Payment program, owners can pay their staff on re-loadable debit cards each pay period instead of having to write out checks or deal with the hassle with direct deposit forms. </p>-->

<p>Gift and Loyalty cards are another great way of extending your brand, offering incentives to current or potential families all while keeping your marketing dollars within your organization. </p>
