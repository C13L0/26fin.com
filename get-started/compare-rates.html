<h3>Comparing Your Options</h3>

<p>We applaud all due diligence efforts when making a decision on your transaction processing provider. A few things to make sure you keep in mind while making your comparisons are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I getting my own merchant account with which process transactions, or is my money getting lumped in with other accounts, and then distributed to me on the aggregator’s timeframe? 
</li> 
<p><i>TwoSix Financial provides your company with its own merchant account and same-day account settlement
</i></p>
<li>Am I being charged just to have an account even when I’m not using it?</li>
<p><i>TwoSix Financial charges NO dormant account fees
</i></p>
</ol>

<p><em>It is always important to make sure you’re aware of the details, and these are very important questions to answer while considering your financial transaction processing solutions. Make sure you’re comparing a Gala apple to another Gala apple, not simply apples to apples.</em></p>
