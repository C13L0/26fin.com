<h3>Comparing Your Options</h3>



<p>TwoSix Financial offers the industry’s lowest per-swipe transaction credit card processing fee available. You are encouraged to carefully review your entire statement, taking stock of every line item and each transaction fee while comparing rates. </P>

<p>We applaud all due diligence efforts when making a decision on your transaction processing provider. A few things to make sure you keep in mind while making your comparisons are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Am I getting my own merchant account with which process transactions, or is my money getting lumped in with other accounts, and then distributed to me on the aggregator’s timeframe? 
</li> 
<p><i>TwoSix Financial provides your company with its own merchant account and same-day account settlement
</i></p>
<li>Am I being charged fees on a monthly, per transaction, or per-amount basis - or all three?
</li>
<P><I>TwoSix Financial has NO hidden fees</I></P>

<li>Am I being charged just to have an account even when I’m not using it?</li>
<p><i>TwoSix Financial charges NO dormant account fees
</i></p>
<li>Are there limits to the amount of money I can accept?</li>
<P><i>TwoSix Financial places no cap on the amount of money or transactions allowed
</i></P>
</ol>

<p>It is always important to make sure you’re aware of the details, and these are very important questions to answer while considering your financial transaction processing solutions. Make sure you’re comparing a Gala apple to another Gala apple, not simply apples to apples. </p>
