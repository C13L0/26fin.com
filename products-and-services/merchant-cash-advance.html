<h3>Merchant Cash Advance</h3>

<p>Need a quick advance for an unforeseen expense? Merchant cash advance can help</p>

<p>Depending upon an organization's previous processing volume, TwoSix Financial can issue a credit line up to 1.5 times the average monthly processed amounts. </p>
<p>Organizations utilize this when they have an last minute repair, unplanned maintenance or other surprise expense to help make the purchases they need immediately</p>
<h6>For example:</h6>
<p>An organization with $50,000 per month in credit card processing that needs a cash advance, would qualify for $50,000 or more with the full amount to be repaid over 6 to 12 months. Cash advances are not loans, but are more like a form of receivable factoring. Repayments are deducted from credit card sales at a rate of about 10%-20% per month until paid in full.</p>
