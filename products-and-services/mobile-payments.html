<h3>Mobile Payments</h3>
<p>New mobile processing technology is able to help you improve your business. TwoSix Financial Solutions has a number of mobile payments to ensure that the right solution is available for your customers. Taking advantage of your mobile devise or tablet to accept credit cards just makes good business sense.

</p>

<p>You can accept credit cards anywhere, anytime with a mobile payments account. Whether you have a service business that works at your customer's location or you take your retail business on the road, mobile payments is an easy and cost-effective way to accept credit cards wherever your customers may be. Businesses that use a mobile account find that they increase sales, save processing time, and reduce expenses (a swiped credit card is considerably less expensive to process than a key entered transaction).</p>
