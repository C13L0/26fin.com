<h3>Check Acceptance and Protection</h3>
<h5>Checks are still a common form of payment, ensure safe acceptance quickly and easily</h5>
<h5>Check Guarantee</h5>
<p>A check guarantee service gives you the ability to accept out-of-town, out-of-state, even checks from Canada and all U.S. Territories safely and with no risk to your organization. The process is simple; checks are validated at the point-of-sale within a few seconds following simple instructions. If a check is returned from the bank, it is submitted to us for processing and reimbursement to you.</p>

<h5>Electronic Checks</h5>
<p>Donâ€™t be limited by only accepting credit cards! E-checks (electronic checks) can perform the same function as a conventional paper check, but can be processed in fewer steps, has more security features, and is all done electronically through your website. </p>

<h5>Recurring EFT/ACH</h5>
<p>TwoSix Financial also provides options for periodic ACH or electronic fund transfer debits from client bank accounts. This includes recurring registration, monthly fees and other repeat expenses.</p>

<h5>Check Conversion</h5>
<p>Make accepting checks as quick and easy as taking credit cards! Check conversion will authorize a check, electronically process the funds,  and deposit them directly into your business bank account without the need to go to the bank to deposit a handful of checks.</p>
